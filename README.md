# Ruby Mod

This was a project I worked on a long time ago in 2021.
The purpose of this project was to learn how to make minecraft mods with Fabric.
It was not made with the intent for it to be used by anyone.
It is made for version 1.16.4.

## Additions

This mod adds:
- Rubies
- Ruby ore (and generation)
- Ruby blocks
- Ruby tools (including bow, shears, and multitool)
- Ruby armor (including horse armor)
- Ruby seeds (a crop that grows rubies)
- Cheese wheels
- Cheesecake (like cake block)

Some those additions might not actually work; I haven't tested it since I last worked on it in 2021.
Futhermore, there may be more additions that I haven't listed here.
I don't fully remember everything I added.
